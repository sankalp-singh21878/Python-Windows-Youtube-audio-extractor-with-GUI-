# Python-Windows-Youtube-audio-extractor-with-GUI-
This project is an application which I developed so that I can extract and save audio from YouTube with only the link of the YouTube video

The repository contains the exe file which has been created using the pyinstaller library

There are two variants of the code available

1.1) The non GUI code which is in songDownloader.py it is the base code without any GUI interface and runs in the CLI
1.2) The GUI code which is in gui.py. It has the GUI interface alongside the base code for a userfriendly usage
